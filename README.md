# React Components Showcase 🚀

A collection of reusable and performance-optimized React components built using **Vite**. This repo is designed to demonstrate clean UI implementations, interactivity, and useful frontend patterns you can plug into your own projects.

## 🌟 What's Inside

This project contains a set of interactive components, each built with best practices in mind. Here's what you'll find:

### 🔁 Card Flipper
- A smooth flip animation that toggles between front (image) and back (description).
- Built using Tailwind CSS and 3D transform utilities.

### ✅ Todo List
- Add, remove, and toggle tasks with persistent state.
- Clean UI with form handling and conditional rendering.

### 📊 Tables
- Custom tables with dynamic rows, headers, and responsive layouts.
- Coming soon: Sorting, filtering, and pagination support.

### 📜 List Virtualization
